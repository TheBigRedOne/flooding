/**
 * @brief Utility class to fetch a versioned and segmented object.
 *
 * SegmentFetcher assumes that segments in the object are named `/<prefix>/<version>/<segment>`,
 * where:
 * - `<prefix>` is an arbitrary name prefix;
 * - `<version>` is the version number (VersionNameComponent);
 * - `<segment>` is the segment number (SegmentNameComponent).
 *
 * The number of segments in the object is generally unknown until a Data packet containing
 * a `FinalBlockId` field is received and validated.
 *
 * The version can either be provided by the application or be discovered at the beginning
 * of the fetching process. By default, SegmentFetcher will attempt to probe the latest
 * version of the object by requesting only "fresh" segments during the initial discovery
 * phase. This behavior can be turned off by setting Options::probeLatestVersion to false.
 *
 * SegmentFetcher implements the following logic:
 *
 * 1. If the application does not provide a `<version>` component and requires probing the
 *    latest version of the object, an Interest with CanBePrefix and MustBeFresh is sent to
 *    discover a fresh version. Otherwise, only CanBePrefix is set.
 *
 * 2. Infer the version of the object: `version = data.getName().get(-2).toVersion()`.
 *
 * 3. Keep sending Interests for future segments until an error occurs or the number of segments
 *    indicated by the FinalBlockId in a received Data packet is reached. This retrieval will start
 *    at segment 1 if segment 0 was received in response to the Interest expressed in step 2;
 *    otherwise, retrieval will start at segment 0. By default, congestion control will be used to
 *    manage the Interest window size. Interests expressed in this step will follow this Name
 *    format: `/<prefix>/<version>/<segment=(N)>`.
 *
 * 4. If set to 'block' mode, signal #onComplete passing a memory buffer that combines the content
 *    of all segments in the object. If set to 'in order' mode, signal #onInOrderData is triggered
 *    upon validation of each segment in segment order, storing later segments that arrived out of
 *    order internally until all earlier segments have arrived and have been validated.
 *
 * If an error occurs during the fetching process, #onError is signaled with one of the error codes
 * from SegmentFetcher::ErrorCode.
 *
 * A Validator instance must be specified to validate individual segments. Every time a segment has
 * been successfully validated, #afterSegmentValidated will be signaled.
 *
 * Example:
 * @code
 * auto fetcher = SegmentFetcher::start(face, Interest("/data/prefix"), validator);
 * fetcher->onComplete.connect([] (ConstBufferPtr data) {...});
 * fetcher->onError.connect([] (uint32_t errorCode, const std::string& errorMsg) {...});
 * @endcode
